## Css

### Position

- ``position:static``

	- The default positioning for all elements is position:static
	- the element is not positioned and occurs where it normally would in the document.

- ``position:relative``

	- you can use top or bottom, and left or right to move the element relative to where it would normally occur in the document.
	- still occupies that original space in the document, even though we have moved it.
	- If we set relative positioning on div-1, any elements within div-1 will be positioned relative to div-1.

- ``position:absolute``

	- When you specify position:absolute, the element is removed from the document and placed exactly where you tell it to go.
